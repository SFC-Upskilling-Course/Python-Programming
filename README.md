# SFC-Upskilling-Course - Python Programming
The repository where we store and maintain the Jupyter notebooks for the python programming module in the SFC upskilling course. These notebooks are derived from the ENG 2083 course developed by Prof Scott Roy.

The notebooks in the repository can be run online on Binder, an online executable environment for notebooks. [Link here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SFC-Upskilling-Course/Python-Programming/HEAD)

Additionally, the repository can also be accessed from [Replit](https://replit.com/@hasantahir2/SFC-Upskilling-Python?v=1).
