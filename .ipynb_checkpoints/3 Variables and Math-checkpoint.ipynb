    "Programming languages use variables (names) to refer to objects, such as numbers, that we wish to reuse again. In Python, variables are assigned with the `=` symbol, e.g., `a = 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can hold almost anything, but we will usually use them to store a number (or an array of multiple numbers). Python and NumPy (more later) both have their own data types, some of which we will cover in this course. Once defined, the variable `a` can be used over and over again. Variables can be used to store information, but you can also do calculations with variables, e.g., `c = a + b`, just like you would with numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Printing Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We may want to check on the value stored in a variable. We can do this using the `print()` function. It is also possible to print out some text (text is referred to in programming as a “string”). You can write a string by surrounding your text with quotation marks. Run the cell below to see all this in action."
