Each statement has a particular goal such as decision, assignment or just repetition (more on that soon).\n",

    "In scientific computing, we often deal with a *bunch* of numbers at the same time. Enter lists, which are a special type of data that can be used to represent matrices, vectors as well as scalars. A list stored in a computer memory is akin to a contiguous series of identical houses on a street. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some preliminary steps when it comes to manipulating data through lists. First, we need to *initialise* a list with some data. Then, if we want to *access* a particular element in a list, we can do so through its index (think of house address). The first house on the street i.e., the first list element has an index 0 (`variable[0]`). Let's look at an example.\n"
