# Variables

A computer program is able to fetch, process and store data in the memory.

- We create variables that are locations in the memory to store and access data
- There are various types of variables in Python
- 


In this module, we will use [Replit](https://replit.com) which is an online integrated development environment to program Python and C codes.
 
We have set up a repository that can be accessed here:
