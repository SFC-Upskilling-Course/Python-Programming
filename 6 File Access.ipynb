    "We have seen how we can create data and access it in the form of `lists`, `tuples` and `dictionaries`. In real life, we might pieces of information from a variety of places. Data curation and structuring is arguably the tedious job which unfortunately still requires a lot of human effort.\n",

    "Data commonly resides in files. Think images captured from a camera, or sound recorded from a music instrument. Most of the times, data can be read from a file just like we can read text out of a word processing document. Here we are going to learn ways in which we can **read** and **write** text files. This comes in very handy to analyse data in real life. Python also allows us to **modify** file contents.\n",
